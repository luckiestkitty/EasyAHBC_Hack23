## Technical Overview

The garden is composed of various palaces, such as the Art Palace, Philosophy Palace, and others. Each palace is situated on a specific blockchain. For instance, the Art Palace is on Ethereum, while the Philosophy Palace is on Algorand. The NFT serves as a representation of the materials housed within each palace. Suppose a user is presently inside the Art Palace (located on Ethereum) and desires to access the Philosophy Palace. In that case, they can use Axelar's inter-chain technology to teleport (convert) their Art NFT on Ethereum to a Philosophy NFT on Algorand.




## How Sponsors Stacks Power US

NFT contracts deployed on Ethereum and Algorand using thirdweb NFT mint SDK and websites.
